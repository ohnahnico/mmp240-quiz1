  <h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
  <h2><cite>Down the Rabbit-Hole</cite></h2>
  <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and <u>of</u> having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “<i>and what is the use of a book,</i>” thought Alice “<i>without pictures or conversations</i>?”</p>

  <p>So she was considering in her own mind <s>(as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid)</s>, whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a <u>White Rabbit</u> with <em>pink eyes</em> ran close by her.</p>

  <p>There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the <u>Rabbit</u> say to itself, <strong><em>“Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!”</em></strong> (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the <u>Rabbit</u> actually <i>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice <u>started</u> to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
